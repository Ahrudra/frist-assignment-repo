                <h1>Zakat Fund</h1>
                <p>Zakat an ARABIC word, meaning sanctity and growth. In fact, the mind of a person who gives zakat is sanctified from the greed for wealth and from miserliness. Moreover, the poor have a right on a portion of the wealth of the rich. Allah says, "And in their wealth and possessions (was remembered) the right of' the needy, him who asked, and him who was prevented from asking" (51:19). Therefore, the wealth of the rich is sanctified by donation of a part of it as zakat. Allah says, Of their goods take alms (sadaqa) that so though mightest purify and santify them" (9:103). The word zakat means growth. It is mentioned in the QURAN that "that which ye (ay out for charity, seeking the Countenance of Allah will increase: it is these who will get a recompense multiplied" (30:39). 
                </p>
                <p>Bdesh foundation collects and distributes zakat to those who are most in need, in accordance with Islamic guidelines. Giving your Zakat through Bdesh means you can provide Food, Job Training, Clean Water, Eye Care, Orphan/Children Welfare, Health Care and so much more.</p>
